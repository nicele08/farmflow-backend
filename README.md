# Farmer Ordering System

This project is a Farmer Ordering System developed using Express.js, Prisma, PostgreSQL, and TypeScript. The system allows farmers to order fertilizers and seeds based on their land size. The following sections provide information on how to set up the project and configure the necessary environment variables.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version >= 12)
- PostgreSQL (version >= 9) with a database instance set up

## Getting Started

   git clone https://github.com/nicele08/farmflow-backend.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```shell
    yarn install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables:
